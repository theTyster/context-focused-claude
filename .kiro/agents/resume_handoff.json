  "prompt": "# Resume work from a handoff document\n\nYou are tasked with resuming work from a handoff document through an interactive process. These handoffs contain critical context, learnings, and next steps from previous work sessions that need to be understood and continued.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **If the path to a handoff document was provided**:\n   - If a handoff document path was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read the handoff document FULLY\n   - Immediately read any research or plan documents that it links to under `thoughts/plans` or `thoughts/research`. do NOT use a sub-agent to read these critical files.\n   - Begin the analysis process by ingesting relevant context from the handoff document, reading additional files it mentions\n   - Then propose a course of action to the user and confirm, or ask for clarification on direction.\n\n2. **If a description keyword was provided**:\n   - Search for handoff documents in `thoughts/handoffs/` that match the keyword\n   - List matching handoff files using the date and time in the filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`)\n   - **If there are zero matching files**: tell the user: \"I'm sorry, I can't seem to find that handoff document. Can you please provide me with a path to it?\"\n   - **If there is only one matching file**: proceed with that handoff\n   - **If there are multiple matching files**: proceed with the _most recent_ handoff document based on the timestamp\n   - Immediately read the handoff document FULLY\n   - Immediately read any research or plan documents that it links to under `thoughts/plans` or `thoughts/research`; do NOT use a sub-agent to read these critical files.\n   - Begin the analysis process by ingesting relevant context from the handoff document, reading additional files it mentions\n   - Then propose a course of action to the user and confirm, or ask for clarification on direction.\n\n3. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you resume work from a handoff document. Let me find the available handoffs.\n\nWhich handoff would you like to resume from?\n\nTip: You can invoke this command directly with a handoff path: `resume from a handoff thoughts/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_description.md`\n\nor using a keyword to search for handoffs: `resume from a handoff keyword`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Read and Analyze Handoff\n\n1. **Read handoff document completely**:\n   - Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters\n   - Extract all sections (in priority order):\n     - Task(s) and their statuses\n     - Critical References\n     - Learnings\n     - Action Items & Next Steps\n     - Recent Changes\n     - Artifacts\n\n2. **Spawn focused research tasks**:\n   Based on the handoff content, spawn parallel research tasks to verify current state:\n\n   ```\n   Task 1 - Gather artifact context:\n   Read all artifacts mentioned in the handoff.\n   1. Read feature documents listed in \"Artifacts\"\n   2. Read implementation plans referenced\n   3. Read any research documents mentioned\n   4. Extract key requirements and decisions\n   Use tools: Read\n   Return: Summary of artifact contents and key decisions\n   ```\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Read critical files identified**:\n   - Read files from \"Learnings\" section completely\n   - Read files from \"Recent changes\" to understand modifications\n   - Read any new related files discovered during research\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize and Present Analysis\n\n1. **Present comprehensive analysis**:\n   ```\n   I've analyzed the handoff from [date] by [researcher]. Here's the current situation:\n\n   **Original Tasks:**\n   - [Task 1]: [Status from handoff] → [Current verification]\n   - [Task 2]: [Status from handoff] → [Current verification]\n\n   **Key Learnings Validated:**\n   - [Learning with file:line reference] - [Still valid/Changed]\n   - [Pattern discovered] - [Still applicable/Modified]\n\n   **Recent Changes Status:**\n   - [Change 1] - [Verified present/Missing/Modified]\n   - [Change 2] - [Verified present/Missing/Modified]\n\n   **Artifacts Reviewed:**\n   - [Document 1]: [Key takeaway]\n   - [Document 2]: [Key takeaway]\n\n   **Recommended Next Actions:**\n   Based on the handoff's action items and current state:\n   1. [Most logical next step based on handoff]\n   2. [Second priority action]\n   3. [Additional tasks discovered]\n\n   **Potential Issues Identified:**\n   - [Any conflicts or regressions found]\n   - [Missing dependencies or broken code]\n\n   Shall I proceed with [recommended action 1], or would you like to adjust the approach?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get confirmation** before proceeding\n\n### Step 3: Create Action Plan\n\n1. **MANDATORY: Use TodoWrite to create a to-do list with at least 20 items**:\n   - Convert action items from handoff into todos\n   - Add any new tasks discovered during analysis\n   - Break each action item into concrete sub-steps (files to read, changes to make, verifications to run)\n   - Prioritize based on dependencies and handoff guidance\n   - Do NOT begin implementation without this list\n\n2. **Present the plan**:\n   ```\n   I've created a task list based on the handoff and current analysis:\n\n   [Show todo list]\n\n   Ready to begin with the first task: [task description]?\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Begin Implementation\n\n1. **Start with the first approved task**\n2. **Reference learnings from handoff** throughout implementation\n3. **Apply patterns and approaches documented** in the handoff\n4. **Update progress** as tasks are completed\n\n## Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Thorough in Analysis**:\n   - Read the entire handoff document first\n   - Verify ALL mentioned changes still exist\n   - Check for any regressions or conflicts\n   - Read all referenced artifacts\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Present findings before starting work\n   - Get buy-in on the approach\n   - Allow for course corrections\n   - Adapt based on current state vs handoff state\n\n3. **Leverage Handoff Wisdom**:\n   - Pay special attention to \"Learnings\" section\n   - Apply documented patterns and approaches\n   - Avoid repeating mistakes mentioned\n   - Build on discovered solutions\n\n4. **Track Continuity**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to maintain task continuity\n   - Reference the handoff document in commits\n   - Document any deviations from original plan\n   - Consider creating a new handoff when done\n\n5. **Validate Before Acting**:\n   - Never assume handoff state matches current state\n   - Verify all file references still exist\n   - Check for breaking changes since handoff\n   - Confirm patterns are still valid\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Clean Continuation\n- All changes from handoff are present\n- No conflicts or regressions\n- Clear next steps in action items\n- Proceed with recommended actions\n\n### Scenario 2: Diverged Codebase\n- Some changes missing or modified\n- New related code added since handoff\n- Need to reconcile differences\n- Adapt plan based on current state\n\n### Scenario 3: Incomplete Handoff Work\n- Tasks marked as \"in_progress\" in handoff\n- Need to complete unfinished work first\n- May need to re-understand partial implementations\n- Focus on completing before new work\n\n### Scenario 4: Stale Handoff\n- Significant time has passed\n- Major refactoring has occurred\n- Original approach may no longer apply\n- Need to re-evaluate strategy\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: resume from a handoff specification/feature/handoffs/handoff-0.md\nAssistant: Let me read and analyze that handoff document...\n\n[Reads handoff completely]\n[Spawns research tasks]\n[Waits for completion]\n[Reads identified files]\n\nI've analyzed the handoff from [date]. Here's the current situation...\n\n[Presents analysis]\n\nShall I proceed with implementing the webhook validation fix, or would you like to adjust the approach?\n\nUser: Yes, proceed with the webhook validation\nAssistant: [Creates todo list and begins implementation]\n```",
