  "prompt": "# Research Codebase\n\nYou are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.\n\n## CRITICAL: YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT AND EXPLAIN THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS TODAY\n- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes unless the user explicitly asks for them\n- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless the user explicitly asks for them\n- DO NOT propose future enhancements unless the user explicitly asks for them\n- DO NOT critique the implementation or identify problems\n- DO NOT recommend refactoring, optimization, or architectural changes\n- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact\n- You are creating a technical map/documentation of the existing system\n\n## Initial Setup:\n\nWhen this command is invoked, respond with:\n```\nI'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Research Depth Requirement\n\n**Use approximately 40% of your context window on research before writing anything.** This means:\n- Spawn at least 3 parallel sub-agent tasks, each with a distinct research focus\n- After sub-agents return, read at least 5–10 of the most relevant files they identified — in full, not just snippets\n- If the first round of research feels shallow, spawn a second round of sub-agents targeting gaps\n- Only begin writing the research document once you have concrete file:line references from multiple components\n\nDo NOT rush to the writing step. The quality of the research document is directly proportional to how many files you actually read and how many sub-agents you spawned. A research session that spawns 1–2 sub-agents and reads 2–3 files will produce an inadequate document.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Create a to-do list using TodoWrite (MANDATORY — minimum 20 items):**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Create a detailed to-do list with at least 20 items covering:\n     - Files to read and analyze\n     - Sub-agents to spawn and their specific focuses\n     - Components and systems to investigate\n     - Patterns, connections, and architectural areas to explore\n     - Cross-references to verify\n     - Sections of the research document to write\n   - Update items as you complete them throughout the process\n   - This list drives your research — do NOT proceed without it\n\n3. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n4. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - researchs to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase_locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase_analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)\n   - Use the **codebase_pattern_finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web_search_researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web_research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving\n\n5. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n6. **Gather metadata and generate research document:**\n   - Run Bash() tools to gather metadata (git commit, branch, date) for the Metadata section\n   - Filename: `thoughts/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic\n     - Examples:\n       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`\n   - **Size budget: 2,000–12,000 tokens.** Maximum 12,000 tokens. If findings exceed the max, split into a summary (primary artifact) and an appendix (reference). The summary is what gets re-ingested; the appendix is for humans drilling in.\n   - **MANDATORY MINIMUM: 2,000 tokens.** Before writing the file, estimate the document's token count. If it would be under 2,000 tokens, you MUST go back and expand: add more file:line references, deeper analysis of each component, more cross-component connections, and more detailed code references. A research document under 2,000 tokens is incomplete and lacks the detail needed for downstream planning. Do NOT write the file until you are confident it meets the minimum.\n   - Structure the document using this rigid template. Every section has minimum requirements — do NOT skip sections or produce fewer items than specified:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     status: complete\n     type: research\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     ## Summary (minimum 3 paragraphs)\n\n     **What exists**: [1-2 paragraph overview of the systems/components involved and how they relate to the research question]\n\n     **How it works**: [1-2 paragraphs describing the key mechanisms, data flow, or architecture patterns discovered]\n\n     **Key implications**: [1 paragraph on what this means for downstream work — constraints, patterns to follow, integration points]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings (minimum 4 components)\n\n     ### Component: [Name]\n\n     **Key files** (minimum 3):\n     - `path/to/file.ext:line` — [what this file does]\n     - `path/to/file.ext:line` — [what this file does]\n     - `path/to/file.ext:line` — [what this file does]\n\n     **Analysis** (minimum 2 paragraphs):\n     [How this component works internally.
